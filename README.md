The model calculates the theoretical price of options using the following formula for a call option:
    
    $$
    C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)
    $$
    
    Where:
    - $C$ = Call option price
    - $S_0$ = Current stock price
    - $K$ = Strike price
    - $T$ = Time to maturity
    - $r$ = Risk-free interest rate
    - $N$ = Cumulative standard normal distribution
    - $d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \\sigma^2/2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}$
    - $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T}$
    
    The put option price is calculated using put-call parity:
    
    $$
    P = K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S_0 N(-d_1)
    $$
